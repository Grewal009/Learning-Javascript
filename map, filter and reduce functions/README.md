## map(), reduce() and filter() functions

### map()

- If we want to perform operation on all the elements of an array then we can use .map() function.
- example: double all the values of an array or iterate all the elements of an array.

### filter()

- fliter() function is used to filter the values of an array.
- example: find odd or even values from an array.

### reduce()

- reduce() function is used at a place where we have to take all the elements of an array and come up with a single value out of them.
- example: iterate through all the elements of an array to find the sum of all the elements of an array.
- reduce() function take two parameters:
  - first callback function.
  - second initial value of an accumulator.
